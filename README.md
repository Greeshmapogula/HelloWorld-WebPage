# HelloWorld-WebPage

For the first time I am starting with *Web Development*. I am decided to start it from the basics i.e; HTML and CSS. I felt learning with doing is better than blindly reading concept. 

This is  Hello World!! page shows usage of all basic tags of HTML. I am using *HTML5* and used *Brackets* text editor to do this(http://brackets.io/).
